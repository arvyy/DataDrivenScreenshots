This module exports some common shaders to be used with container

[source,scheme]
----
(use-modules (dds stdshader))

=== opacity

[source,scheme]
----
(opacity k)
----

Makes container partially transparent. `k` should be in range of 0 to 1 -- from fully transparent, to fullu opaque.


=== grayscale

[source,scheme]
----
(grayscale k)
----

Grays out colors of the container. `k` should be in range of 0 to 1 -- from normal colors, to fully gray.

=== blur

[source,scheme]
----
(blur resolution radius horizontal?)
----

Applies blur. `horizontal?` refers whether content is blured horizontal direction; if #f it's blured vertically. Resolution is width/height depending on `horizontal?`, `radius` is blurring radius.
