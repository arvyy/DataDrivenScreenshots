== Affine Transform

Affine transforms are vectors of length 6 that represent 4x4 transformation matrix. `(vector a b c d e f)` is interpreted as

  a b 0 c
  d e 0 f
  0 0 1 0
  0 0 0 1

=== translate

[source,scheme]
----
(translate tx ty)
----

Creates a translation affine transformation, where `tx` is translation over x axis, and `ty` -- over y axis.

=== rotate

[source,scheme]
----
(rotate k)
----

Creates a rotation affine transformation, where `k` is rotation in degrees clockwise in degrees.

=== scale

[source,scheme]
----
(scale kx ky)
----

Creates a scale affine transformation, where `kx` is scaling along x axis, and `ky` -- along y.

=== combine

[source,scheme]
----
(combine [transformation ...])
----

Combines given transformations into one. As usual with matrices, order matters.

Example

[source,scheme]
----
(define tr (translate 50 60))
(define rot (rotate 45))
(define sc (scale 3))
(combine sc rot tr)
----
